# ADR-025: Development Planning and Documentation Standards

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Unipress project has grown into a professional-grade software project with comprehensive architecture, multiple systems, and established workflows. As the project evolves, we need formal standards for:

1. **Planning major development initiatives** - Features, architectural changes, tool adoption
2. **Git Flow automation and enforcement** - Ensuring consistent branching and commit standards
3. **Documentation of decision-making processes** - Transparency in project direction
4. **Integration with existing documentation** - ADRs, CHANGELOG, README, CLAUDE.md

The need for planning standards was highlighted during Claude Code enhancement discussions, where the importance of avoiding over-engineering and maintaining project alignment became clear.

## Decision
Establish comprehensive development planning and documentation standards with the following components:

### 1. Formal Planning Process
- **When Required**: Major features, architectural changes, tool adoption, process changes
- **Plan Storage**: Version-controlled in `/docs/plans/` directory
- **Plan Format**: Standardized template with executive summary, phases, metrics, risks
- **Review Process**: Required approval before implementation
- **Lifecycle Management**: Draft ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed/Cancelled

### 2. Git Flow Automation and Enforcement
- **Mandatory Checklist**: Added to CLAUDE.md as critical requirement before any changes
- **Slash Commands**: `/git-start`, `/qa`, `/test-coverage`, `/new-game` for workflow automation
- **Branch Naming**: Enforced conventions (feat/, fix/, docs/, chore/, release/)
- **Commit Standards**: git-cz format with emojis as mandatory requirement
- **Quality Gates**: All commits must pass ruff, mypy, pytest checks

### 3. Documentation Integration
- **Plans Directory**: `/docs/plans/` with README.md index and status tracking
- **ADR Integration**: Architectural decisions document plan outcomes
- **CHANGELOG Integration**: Plan implementations recorded in version history  
- **TODO Integration**: Active plans drive priority task lists

### 4. Claude Code Enhancement Standards
- **Assistant Behavior**: Mandatory Git Flow checklist prevents workflow bypass
- **Automation Tools**: Custom slash commands for common development tasks
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in commands ensure code standards compliance
- **Project Context**: Enhanced CLAUDE.md provides comprehensive development guidance

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- ‚úÖ Create `/docs/plans/` directory structure with README.md index
- ‚úÖ Add mandatory Git Flow checklist to CLAUDE.md with commit standards
- ‚úÖ Create essential slash commands: `/git-start`, `/qa`, `/test-coverage`, `/new-game`
- ‚úÖ Write ADR-025 documenting these standards

### Phase 2: Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Save Claude Code Enhancement Plan as first documented plan
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to reference new planning standards
- [ ] Add plan management to workflow documentation
- [ ] Update README.md contributing section with planning process

### Phase 3: Automation and Tooling (Future)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks
- [ ] Create additional slash commands based on usage patterns
- [ ] Integrate coverage reporting into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add automated plan status tracking

## Plan Template Structure

- Risk 2: Description and mitigation strategy

## Resource Requirements
- Time investment: X hours over Y weeks
- Tools and dependencies
- Learning curve considerations

## Implementation Strategy

## Git Flow Automation Features

### Mandatory Pre-Work Checklist
```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Switch to master and get latest  
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 3. Create appropriately named feature branch
git checkout -b [type]/[descriptive-name]

# 4. Verify clean start
git status
```

### Commit Message Standards
- **Format**: `type(scope): emoji subject`
- **Required Types**: featüé∏, fixüêõ, docs‚úèÔ∏è, choreü§ñ, styleüíÑ, refactorüí°, testüíç, perf‚ö°, ciüé°
- **Critical Rules**: Separate commits for unrelated changes, one logical change per commit

### Quality Automation
- `/qa` - Full quality pipeline (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- `/test-coverage` - Coverage analysis and gap identification
- `/git-start [type] [name]` - Automated branch creation with validation

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Transparency**: All major decisions documented with rationale
- **Consistency**: Enforced Git Flow and commit standards prevent workflow bypass
- **Quality**: Automated quality checks ensure code standards compliance
- **Efficiency**: Slash commands reduce repetitive workflow tasks
- **Accountability**: Plans create commitment and trackable progress
- **Learning**: Failed or modified plans provide lessons for future planning

### Negative
- **Overhead**: Planning process adds time to development workflow
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to learn new planning and automation tools
- **Maintenance**: Plans and slash commands require ongoing updates
- **Enforcement Burden**: Ensuring standards compliance requires discipline

### Neutral
- **Documentation Growth**: Plans directory will grow over time, requiring organization
- **Tool Dependency**: Increased reliance on Claude Code and custom automation

## Rationale

### Planning Standards Justification
1. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Formal planning helps identify unnecessary complexity early
2. **Project Alignment**: Plans ensure new initiatives align with established goals
3. **Resource Management**: Clear timelines and requirements prevent scope creep
4. **Decision Documentation**: Historical record of why decisions were made

### Git Flow Automation Justification  
1. **Prevent Workflow Bypass**: Mandatory checklist in CLAUDE.md ensures Git Flow compliance
2. **Reduce Errors**: Automated branch creation eliminates naming convention mistakes
3. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in QA commands ensure all changes meet standards
4. **Developer Experience**: Slash commands reduce repetitive tasks and cognitive load

### Integration Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: CLAUDE.md becomes comprehensive development guide
2. **Workflow Continuity**: Plans integrate with existing ADR and changelog processes
3. **Professional Standards**: Establishes enterprise-grade development practices
4. **Team Scalability**: Standards support future team growth and contributor onboarding
