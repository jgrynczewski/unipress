# 019. HTTP Server Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

After deciding to implement an HTTP server architecture for game management (ADR-018), we need to choose a specific HTTP framework for Python. The framework should be lightweight, easy to use, and suitable for a simple REST API server.

## Decision

We will use **Flask** as the HTTP framework for implementing the game server API.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simplicity**: Minimal boilerplate code, easy to understand and maintain
- **Lightweight**: Small footprint, fast startup time
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and customize as needed
- **Mature ecosystem**: Well-established with extensive documentation and community
- **REST API support**: Excellent support for REST endpoints with minimal setup
- **Error handling**: Built-in error handling and status code management
- **Testing**: Easy to test with Flask's testing utilities
- **Development speed**: Rapid prototyping and development

### Negative

- **Performance**: Not as fast as async frameworks for high-concurrency scenarios
- **Scalability**: Limited compared to async frameworks for thousands of concurrent requests
- **Dependencies**: Adds Flask and Werkzeug to project dependencies
- **Learning curve**: Team needs to understand Flask patterns (minimal for simple APIs)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. FastAPI
**Pros:**
- High performance (async/await)
- Automatic API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Type hints and validation
- Modern async Python support
- Excellent for microservices

**Cons:**
- Overkill for simple game management API
- More complex setup and dependencies
- Steeper learning curve
- Additional dependencies (Pydantic, uvicorn)
- Not needed for simple request/response patterns

### 2. Django REST Framework
**Pros:**
- Full-featured web framework
- Excellent admin interface
- Built-in authentication and permissions
- Comprehensive ORM
- Enterprise-ready

**Cons:**
- Massive overkill for simple API
- Heavy dependencies and slow startup
- Complex configuration
- Database dependency (not needed)
- Too much abstraction for simple use case

### 3. aiohttp
**Pros:**
- High performance async framework
- Lightweight
- Good for real-time applications
- Modern async Python

**Cons:**
- More complex than Flask for simple APIs
- Async/await complexity not needed
- Steeper learning curve
- Overkill for simple request/response

### 4. Bottle
**Pros:**
- Single file framework
- Very lightweight
- No dependencies
- Simple to use

**Cons:**
- Limited ecosystem
- Less community support
- Fewer features than Flask
- Less mature than Flask

### 5. CherryPy
**Pros:**
- Object-oriented design
- Built-in web server
- Good performance
- Mature framework

**Cons:**
- More complex than Flask
- Different paradigm (object-oriented vs function-based)
- Less popular and fewer resources
- Overkill for simple API

### 6. Tornado
**Pros:**
- High performance async framework
- Good for real-time applications
- Non-blocking I/O

**Cons:**
- Async complexity not needed
- More complex than Flask
- Overkill for simple REST API
- Steeper learning curve

## Technical Comparison

| Framework | Performance | Complexity | Dependencies | Learning Curve | Ecosystem |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Flask** | Good | Low | Minimal | Low | Excellent |
| FastAPI | Excellent | Medium | Medium | Medium | Good |
| Django REST | Good | High | Heavy | High | Excellent |
| aiohttp | Excellent | Medium | Low | Medium | Good |
| Bottle | Good | Low | None | Low | Limited |
| CherryPy | Good | Medium | Low | Medium | Limited |
| Tornado | Excellent | High | Low | High | Limited |

## Implementation Considerations

### Flask Advantages for Our Use Case

1. **Simple REST API**: Flask excels at simple REST endpoints
2. **Minimal overhead**: Perfect for low-traffic game management
3. **Easy debugging**: Simple request/response cycle
4. **JSON handling**: Excellent built-in JSON support
5. **Error handling**: Simple error response patterns
6. **Testing**: Easy to test with Flask test client

### Performance Analysis

For our use case (game management API):
- **Request volume**: Low (few requests per minute)
- **Response time**: Not critical (games take seconds to start)
- **Concurrency**: Minimal (single user launching games)
- **Flask performance**: More than adequate

### Dependency Impact

Flask adds minimal dependencies:
- `flask>=3.0.0` - Core framework
- `werkzeug` - WSGI utilities (included with Flask)
- `jinja2` - Template engine (included with Flask)

Total additional size: ~2MB

## Migration Path

If performance becomes an issue in the future:
1. **Profile first**: Identify actual bottlenecks
2. **Optimize Flask**: Use production WSGI server (gunicorn)
3. **Consider FastAPI**: Only if async benefits are needed
4. **Microservice split**: Separate high-traffic endpoints
