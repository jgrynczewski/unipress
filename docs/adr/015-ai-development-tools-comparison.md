# ADR-015: AI Development Tools Comparison and Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires AI assistance for code generation, debugging, documentation, and architectural decisions. Multiple AI development tools are available in the market, each with different capabilities, pricing models, and integration approaches. A systematic evaluation is needed to select the most suitable tool for the Unipress project.

## Evaluated Options

### 1. GitHub Copilot
**Strengths:**
- Excellent IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim)
- Real-time code completion and suggestions
- Large training dataset from GitHub repositories
- Strong context awareness within files
- $10/month individual pricing

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited conversation/chat capabilities
- No CLI interface for interactive development
- Focused primarily on code completion, not architectural planning
- Limited ability to work with multiple files simultaneously
- No direct version control integration

### 2. ChatGPT (OpenAI)
**Strengths:**
- Excellent conversational AI for problem-solving
- Strong reasoning capabilities for architecture decisions
- Good code generation across multiple languages
- Web interface and API availability
- $20/month for GPT-4 access

**Weaknesses:**
- No direct IDE integration
- No version control integration
- Context window limitations for large codebases
- Manual copy-paste workflow reduces efficiency
- No file system access for direct code manipulation

### 3. Claude Code (Anthropic)
**Strengths:**
- Purpose-built CLI for development workflows
- Direct file system access and modification
- Integrated version control (git) operations
- Large context window (200K+ tokens)
- Multi-file codebase understanding
- Interactive development sessions
- Built-in quality checks integration (ruff, mypy, pytest)
- Automatic commit generation with proper formatting

**Weaknesses:**
- Newer tool with smaller user base
- CLI-only interface (no IDE integration)
- Requires command-line familiarity
- Premium pricing model

### 4. Cursor IDE
**Strengths:**
- AI-native code editor built on VS Code
- Integrated chat and code generation
- Good context awareness across files
- Real-time collaboration with AI
- Reasonable pricing model

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires switching from existing IDE setup
- Limited to specific editor environment
- Less mature ecosystem compared to established tools
- No CLI capabilities for scripting/automation

### 5. Amazon CodeWhisperer
**Strengths:**
- Good IDE integration
- Free tier available
- Security scanning capabilities
- AWS ecosystem integration

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited conversational capabilities
- Primarily code completion focused
- Less sophisticated architectural reasoning
- Smaller training dataset compared to competitors

## Decision
Select **Claude Code** as the primary AI development tool for the Unipress project.

## Rationale

### Key Decision Factors

1. **Workflow Integration**
   - Claude Code provides seamless CLI-based development workflow
   - Direct file manipulation without copy-paste overhead
   - Integrated git operations with proper commit formatting
   - Supports the project's command-line development environment

2. **Codebase Understanding**
   - Large context window handles entire project scope
   - Multi-file awareness for architectural decisions
   - Understands project structure and conventions
   - Maintains context across development sessions

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Built-in integration with quality tools (ruff, mypy, pytest)
   - Automatic code formatting and linting
   - Enforces project standards and conventions
   - Generates proper documentation and ADRs

4. **Development Efficiency**
   - Interactive problem-solving sessions
   - Real-time code generation and testing
   - Automatic commit generation with conventional formats
   - Reduces context switching between tools

5. **Project Alignment**
   - Matches the project's professional development standards
   - Supports the established CI/CD pipeline
   - Compatible with existing toolchain (uv, ruff, mypy, pytest)
   - Generates comprehensive documentation

### Demonstrated Success
The tool has already proven effective in implementing:
- Complex parallax background system
- Physics-based obstacle spacing algorithms
- Responsive window scaling
- Comprehensive asset management system
- Professional documentation and ADRs

## Implementation

### Primary Use Cases
- **Architecture Planning**: Interactive sessions for system design
- **Code Generation**: Feature implementation with quality checks
- **Debugging**: Problem diagnosis and resolution
- **Documentation**: ADR creation and code documentation
- **Refactoring**: Code structure improvements and optimization

### Quality Gates
- All AI-generated code must pass: `ruff check && ruff format && mypy && pytest`
- Human review required for architectural decisions
- Incremental commits with proper conventional commit format
- Comprehensive testing of generated features

### Workflow Integration
```bash
# Typical development session
claude-code  # Start interactive session
# AI generates code with immediate testing
# Automatic git commits with proper formatting
# Real-time quality checks and validation
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Accelerated development with maintained quality standards
- Consistent documentation and architectural decision recording
- Seamless integration with existing development workflow
- Comprehensive codebase understanding for complex changes
- Professional commit history and version control practices

### Negative
- Higher cost compared to some alternatives ($20+/month estimated)
- CLI-only interface requires command-line proficiency
- Dependency on single vendor for development assistance
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with the tool

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain traditional development capabilities as backup
- Document AI-assisted workflows for team knowledge transfer
- Regular evaluation of alternative tools as market evolves
- Human oversight for all critical architectural decisions

## Future Considerations
- Monitor emerging AI development tools (Cursor, new GitHub Copilot features)
- Evaluate IDE integration options as they become available
- Consider hybrid approaches combining multiple tools
- Regular cost-benefit analysis as usage patterns evolve
