## Phase 1: Core Mechanics (High Priority)

### Setup & Project Structure
- [x] **setup-001**: Create jump_sky project directory structure (games/jump_sky/, __init__.py, game.py, settings.toml)
- [x] **setup-002**: Create asset directory structure (assets/images/games/jump_sky/{birds,fruits}, assets/sounds/games/jump_sky/)
- [x] **setup-003**: Create localization files structure (locales/{pl_PL,en_US}/games/jump_sky.json)

### Git Flow & Configuration
- [x] **git-001**: Follow Git Flow: switch to master, pull latest, create feat/jump-sky-game branch
- [x] **config-001**: Create jump_sky settings.toml with essential configuration (physics, spawn, velocity, height, scoring)

### Base Game Implementation
- [x] **base-001**: Create basic JumpSkyGame class inheriting from BaseGame with constructor and initial setup
- [x] **physics-001**: Copy and adapt player physics from jumper game (gravity, jump mechanics, movement)

### Visual Fallback Systems
- [x] **fallback-001**: Implement visual fallback system for fruits (apple=green circle+red border, banana=yellow crescent, pineapple=orange diamond, orange=orange circle)
- [x] **fallback-002**: Implement visual fallback system for birds (3 colored triangles: red, blue, purple with simple rotation animation)
- [x] **fallback-003**: Implement visual fallback system for player (blue rectangle with simple leg animation)
- [x] **fallback-004**: Implement visual fallback system for background layers (gradient sky, gray triangular mountains, green tree rectangles, brown ground)

### Core Game Classes
- [x] **classes-001**: Create Fruit class with properties: fruit_type, points, velocity, position, fallback_shape
- [x] **classes-002**: Create Bird class with properties: bird_type, velocity, position, animation_frame, fallback_shape

### Velocity Systems
- [x] **velocity-001**: Implement fruit velocity system based on point values (apple=1.0x, banana=1.3x, pineapple=1.6x, orange=2.0x)
- [x] **velocity-002**: Implement bird velocity randomization system (0.8x to 1.8x multiplier per spawn)
- [x] **velocity-003**: Integrate velocity system with difficulty scaling (base speed affected by difficulty 1-10)

### Spawn Systems
- [x] **spawn-001**: Implement basic spawn system with 1 bird per 4 fruits ratio (bird_to_fruit_ratio = 0.25)
- [x] **spawn-002**: Implement height randomization for objects (both birds and fruits: 60-150 pixels above ground)
- [x] **spawn-003**: Implement maximum 4 simultaneous objects constraint
- [x] **spawn-004**: Implement safe zones (periods with only fruits, no birds)
- [x] **spawn-005**: Implement random bird type selection (bird1, bird2, bird3) per spawn

### Collision Detection
- [x] **collision-001**: Implement fruit collision detection (throughout jump arc, fruit disappears, add points)
- [x] **collision-002**: Implement bird collision detection (only when jumping, lose life, higher Z-order priority)
- [x] **collision-003**: Implement collision priority system (bird collision overrides fruit collision)

### Scoring & Lives System
- [x] **scoring-001**: Implement scoring system (apple=10, banana=15, pineapple=20, orange=25 points)
- [x] **scoring-002**: Implement score display UI (integrate with BaseGame UI system)
- [x] **lives-001**: Integrate standard 3-lives system from BaseGame (bird collision triggers life loss)
- [x] **lives-002**: Implement pause-after-death mechanics (player blinking, click to continue)

### Audio & Internationalization
- [x] **audio-001**: Implement basic audio system with silent fallback (no crash if sounds missing)
- [x] **audio-002**: Define sound events: fruit_catch, bird_touched, jump, game_start, high_score
- [x] **i18n-001**: Create basic Polish localization messages (ui.score, ui.lives, ui.game_over, ui.instructions)
- [x] **i18n-002**: Create basic English fallback localization messages

### Phase 1 Testing & QA
- [x] **test-001**: Test Phase 1: Basic gameplay with fallback visuals works correctly
- [x] **test-002**: Test Phase 1: Verify fruit collection scoring and bird collision life loss
- [x] **test-003**: Test Phase 1: Verify spawn ratio approximately 1 bird per 4 fruits
- [x] **test-004**: Test Phase 1: Verify velocity differences visible (higher-value fruits faster, birds random speeds)
- [x] **test-005**: Test Phase 1: Verify different bird types spawn randomly (different colored triangles)
- [x] **test-006**: Test Phase 1: Verify fallback visual system works (recognizable shapes, animated birds)
- [x] **qa-001**: Run quality checks: ruff check && ruff format && mypy unipress

2. **Pull Requests**: Create MR/PR for every completed significant task for review
3. **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional format: `feat: ðŸŽ¸ add basic JumpSkyGame class`
4. **Atomic Changes**: One logical change per commit, never bundle unrelated fixes
