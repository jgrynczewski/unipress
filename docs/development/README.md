# Development Documentation Structure

This directory contains working documents created during feature development and implementation. These files are important artifacts of the development process and provide insight into the planning, implementation, and testing phases.

## 📋 File Types and Conventions

### Features Directory (`features/`)

**Naming Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-implementation.md`

**Content Structure:**
- Feature overview and requirements
- Technical specifications
- Implementation phases
- Architecture decisions
- Asset requirements
- Testing criteria

**Examples:**
- `2025-09-06-jump-sky-game-implementation.md` - Complete Jump Sky game implementation plan
- `2025-XX-XX-multiplayer-system-implementation.md` - Future multiplayer feature plan

### Todos Directory (`todos/`)
Contains task lists, progress tracking, and todo items for specific features or projects.

**Naming Convention:** `feature-name-todo.md`

**Content Structure:**
- Task breakdown (setup, implementation, polish, testing)
- Progress tracking with checkboxes
- Priority levels (high, medium, low)
- Status indicators (pending, in_progress, completed)
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Testing requirements

**Examples:**
- `jump-sky-todo.md` - Jump Sky game task list and progress tracking
- `audio-system-todo.md` - Audio system enhancement tasks

### Planning Directory (`planning/`)
Contains high-level planning documents, strategies, and architectural planning.

**Naming Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD-plan-name.md`

**Content Structure:**
- Strategic objectives

- Success criteria

**Examples:**
- `2025-XX-XX-game-engine-migration-plan.md` - Engine migration strategy
- `2025-XX-XX-performance-optimization-plan.md` - Performance improvement plan

### Testing Directory (`testing/`)
Contains test plans, test results, QA documents, and testing methodologies.

**Naming Convention:** 
- `feature-name-test-plan.md` - Test planning documents
- `YYYY-MM-DD-test-results-feature-name.md` - Test execution results
- `qa-checklist-feature-name.md` - Quality assurance checklists

**Content Structure:**
- Test scenarios and cases
- Expected vs actual results
- Bug reports and fixes
- Performance benchmarks
- Compatibility testing

**Examples:**
- `jump-sky-test-plan.md` - Jump Sky game testing strategy
- `2025-09-14-test-results-jump-sky.md` - Jump Sky test execution results

## 🔄 Development Workflow Integration

### Creating New Features
1. **Create implementation plan** in `features/` directory
2. **Create todo list** in `todos/` directory  
3. **Create test plan** in `testing/` directory
4. **Link documents** using cross-references
5. **Update progress** throughout development

### Document Lifecycle
1. **Planning Phase**: Create feature implementation plan
2. **Task Breakdown**: Create detailed todo list
3. **Implementation**: Update progress in todo documents
4. **Testing Phase**: Create and execute test plans
5. **Completion**: Archive or move to historical documentation

### Cross-References
Use relative links to connect related documents:
```markdown
- Implementation Plan: [Jump Sky Implementation](../features/2025-09-06-jump-sky-game-implementation.md)
- Task List: [Jump Sky Todo](../todos/jump-sky-todo.md)
- Test Plan: [Jump Sky Testing](../testing/jump-sky-test-plan.md)
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Todo List Standards
All todo documents should follow this format:
```markdown
- [ ] **task-id**: Task description
- [x] **task-id**: Completed task description - **COMPLETED** ✅ Brief completion note
```

### Status Indicators
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Task fully implemented and tested
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Currently being worked on
- ⏸️ **BLOCKED** - Waiting for dependencies
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** - High priority, blocking other work

### Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Core functionality, blocking other features
- **Medium Priority**: Important features, quality improvements
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have, non-critical enhancements

## 🗂️ File Management

### Archiving Completed Work
When features are fully implemented and deployed:
1. **Mark todos as completed** with final status
2. **Create summary** in the implementation plan
3. **Move to archive** if needed (e.g., `docs/development/archive/`)
4. **Update cross-references** in related documents

### Version Control
All development documents should be:
- ✅ Committed to version control
- ✅ Updated with meaningful commit messages
- ✅ Linked to relevant pull requests
- ✅ Tagged with completion status

## 🔍 Finding Documents

### By Feature
Look in `features/` for implementation plans, then check corresponding `todos/` for progress tracking.

### By Status
- **Active Development**: Check `todos/` for in-progress items
- **Planning Phase**: Check `planning/` and `features/` directories
- **Testing Phase**: Check `testing/` directory

### By Date
All major documents include creation dates in filenames for chronological tracking.
