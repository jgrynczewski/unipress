# Unipress Documentation

Welcome to the Unipress documentation! Unipress is a collection of one-button games built with Python and the Arcade framework.

> **Note**: This documentation is also available on [Read the Docs](https://unipress.readthedocs.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://jgrynczewski.github.io/unipress/).

## üéÆ What is Unipress?

Unipress is a professional-grade game development framework that focuses on **one-button games** - games where players can only send binary signals (click/press) without cursor positioning or element selection. All interactions use timing-based or automatic cycling mechanics.

### Key Features

- **One-Button Constraint**: All games work with single button input only
- **Professional Architecture**: Modern Python development with best practices
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new games with consistent structure
- **Comprehensive Systems**: Settings, sound, logging, internationalization
- **Container Support**: Docker-based deployment with audio/GPU support
- **HTTP Server**: API-based game management for scalable deployment
